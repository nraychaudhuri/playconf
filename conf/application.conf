# Global object class
# ~~~~~
# Define the Global object class for this application.
# Default to Global in the root package.

# Router 
# ~~~~~
# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
# so make sure this is the entry point. 
# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly. 
# So for an application router like `conf/my.application.Router`,

# Root logger:
logger.root=INFO

# Logger used by the framework:
logger.play=INFO

# Logger provided to your application:
logger.application=INFO
