						<h2>Scala in Action</h2>
						<p>You don't yet speak Scala? Then let us invite you to a journey on which we will explore the outstanding features of this programming language for the Java Virtual Machine. As an introduction we will briefly talk about Scala's key characteristics. Then we will explore this language and some of its typical applications, e.g. concise OO and powerful functional collections. If you are a developer and expect vivid examples and live coding, then you will like this session.</p>
